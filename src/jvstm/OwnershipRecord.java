 * Each ReadWriteTransaction uses an instance of this class to represent that
 * it owns the write access to the temporary value of a given VBox in which it
 * successfully sets this instance.
 *
 * Even if (for a while) other transactions do not see any updates to the
 * default initial value (zero), they will behave as if the current owner is
 * still running, which is a safe behavior.  Eventually, the owner will (only
 * once) set either -1 or a value greater than zero.  When other transactions
 * see this value they will act accordingly.  We leverage on the fact the in
 * the Java Memory Model, values do not appear "out of the blue", i.e., a
 * reader will either see the default value or a value that was actually set.
